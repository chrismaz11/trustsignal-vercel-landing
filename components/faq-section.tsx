    question: "Does Trust Signal replace notaries, title insurance, or recorders?",
    answer:
      "No. Trust Signal is a pre-recording verification checkpoint for title operations. Notaries perform standard duties, title insurance remains in place, and county recorders retain final recording authority. Trust Signal provides an independent integrity signal—not a replacement for existing processes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a PASS or FLAG signal mean operationally?",
    answer:
      "A PASS indicates document integrity and metadata consistency based on cryptographic validation and registry cross-checks. A FLAG alerts operations to a potential anomaly for internal review. Neither constitutes a legal determination—Trust Signal outputs an integrity signal, not a legal opinion.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a document is flagged?",
    answer:
      "Flagged documents are routed to internal compliance or operations for review. The pilot operates in observation mode: flags provide visibility without blocking transactions, allowing participants to assess signal accuracy and establish baselines for anomaly types (fraud vs. clerical errors).",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the 60-day pilot work for title operations?",
    answer:
      "The pilot applies pre-recording verification to a limited transaction set in live workflows. Participants receive integrity signals, audit documentation, and an end-of-pilot findings report. The scope is time-boxed and does not require system replacement, staff retraining, or long-term commitment.",
  },
